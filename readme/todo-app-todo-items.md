1. [pending] When we check off a sub-task we should still see it! Just maybe line-clamp to 1 line, strikethrough, move to bottom section.

2. [pending] for existing todoist items, change "drop" to just "archive" an item, not delete it

3. [pending] When I click “complete” on a task, collapse it and turn its status from “stale” to “completed” and turn it to completed style, gray, until the mutation completes and it removes from the DOM. This is partial optimistic return.

4. [pending] Is it possible to capture the audio itself instead of having to clean up the text and submit? Sometimes the transcription is quite far off and I want to just come back to it later. And wnat a button that says that. And It's okay if it stores just on this device as long as I can do the text + submit at a later time. the "process" page can also include references to these!

5. [pending] the navigation tabs should have URLs, no?

6. [pending] we don't need to strikethrough the main item titles on the "done" page. we know it's done! everything is done.

7. [pending] let's have more human readable dates! "4 days" rather than "2026-02-27" or even "Mar 27" when it's farther off

8. [pending] let's only see un-archived items by default!

9. [pending] on the 'capture' page, down at the bottom maybe, let's have a list of the un-processed items, like we're stacking them as we go, adding to the top of the list showing how high the stack is
