1. [pending] When we check off a sub-task we should still see it! Just maybe line-clamp to 1 line, strikethrough, move to bottom section.

2. [pending] Please explain what “drop” does w/r/t the Todoist item? Is it changing it in Todoist, or just hiding it from our interface?

3. [pending] When I click “complete” on a task, collapse it and turn its status from “stale” to “completed” and turn it to completed style, gray and strikethrough, until the mutation completes and it removes from the DOM. This is partial optimistic return.

4. [pending] When opening and closing items in the list, please have some kind of transition, whether a height transition or like do the height immediately but fade-in the text using opacity transition, so I have a visual cue for what’s new / entering. Transition out can also be done either way.

5. [pending] On the “process” page, it shouldn’t be “part of an existing goal” it should be “part of an existing task” and all the tasks come up, only tasks that have no parent task, sorting by number of sub-tasks and recent updates.

6. [pending] Is it possible to capture the audio itself instead of having to clean up the text and submit? Sometimes the transcription is quite far off and I want to just come back to it later. And wnat a button that says that. And It's okay if it stores just on this device as long as I can do the text + submit at a later time. the "process" page can also include references to these!

7. [pending] the navigation tabs should have URLs, no?

8. [pending] we don't need to strikethrough the main item titles on the "done" page. we know it's done! everything is done.

9. [pending] let's have more human readable dates! "4 days" rather than "2026-02-27" or even "Mar 27" when it's farther off

10. [pending] let's only see un-archived items by default!

11.
