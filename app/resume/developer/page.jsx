}

const intro = `Hello, ðŸ‘‹ I&rsquo;m Em, a former
organiser, data analyst, tech director, then facilitator,
turned product manager, data engineer and full stack developer.

In 2020 I decided to leave management to focus on my own work
as an individual contributor, honing my craft at Product Management,
Data Engineering, and Full-stack Web Development.
I love it, but as a freelancer and solo developer,
I miss being _part of a team_ &ndash; if you want to stay in flow,
nothing beats good teamwork.

So I'm looking for full-time employment, membership in a coop, or partnership in an
agency &ndash; to keep learning, keep shipping, keep going.

I'm most comfortable with full-stack JS frameworks like NextJS or
React Router, and with databases, so naturally I prefer to keep the API layer nice and simple.
But I consider myself flexible and practical with solutions, no matter what tools we decide to use for the job.

Mostly I care about working on a team that fosters productivity,
growth and accountability.
I want to learn new things, be excellent to my colleagues,
ship quality product every cycle &ndash;
and then close the computer and enjoy my weekend. If this sounds like
your workplace, please reach out!

  The old version was a custom ETL app built with DRF, and a 2017-era React/Redux app. I was contracted to make recommendations
  for the in-house team, and ended up building it as well.

  The org was already using BigQuery to warehouse data from each of the 3 required datasources, so I was able to replace the
  (big) ETL back-end with a (small) DataForm project. Each API endpoint pulled data from one of three Views that
  handled the data & privacy logic into a system with its own (strict) review and deployment
  policies, letting me work with more confidence and velocity on the rest of the app.

  I did the rest with NextJS, React Query and TailwindCSS, replacing most of the embed options with a handful
  of [independent routes/pages](https://map.350.org/).
  The result is a simple app with a handful of re-useable components, hooks, API routes, 
  assembled under different pages which we can extend, adjust, and theme as-needed
  without sacrificing code quality or exploding complexity.`,

  I started sketching in 2015 when I first came to India and wanted to learn

  on apps like Duolingo, which try to be "social" through gamification but don't
  do anything to make use of the role that friends and family can play, particularly in learning a language.

  The app is currently unreleased because I mostly use it as a playground to learn.
  Over the last few months I've used it to do deep-dive experiments with SolidJS, SvelteKit, and [React Router](https://sunlo-tanstack.vercel.app),
  which has taught me a lot about hoisting data requirements, the non-React ecosystem, Signals, Vite, Vinxi, and more.
  Sunlo also compiles to native iOS and Android apps with Tauri, allowing for a buttery smooth UX that's the same on device or in the browser.`,

							<p>
								At VoteAmerica I was called in to manage Product for the last 4
								months of the election cycle. We had a team of about 6 Engineers
								working on a national system to help voters look up their
								registration, request an absentee ballot, or get help with their
								voting journey.
							</p>
							<p>
								When Election Day got closer and we launched our campaign to
								send 100 Million text messages to voters across the country, the
								outreach team came to us for help with their data pipeline, and
								since election day was about 6 weeks away, most of the product
								was already managed, so I also built the SQL pipeline that
								updated our national voter file, selected the most likely/most
								accurate phone number for each household (or in many cases the
								most likely voter identity for a number) and built the priority
								lists for each state on a rolling/nightly basis.
							</p>
							<p>
								And I had the pleasure to manage an experiment in a truly new
								way of doing voter outreach: a system called The Voter Helpline
								which allows volunteers in a Slack team to claim and respond to
								incoming text messages from voters asking for help. In all my
								years doing organising through digital tools like this I&apos;ve
								never seen such incredible engagement rates as when we
								structured interactions this way, with volunteers in small
								&ldquo;pods&ldquo; that look out for each other&apos;s contacts,
								and a lot of claiming/assigning/notifying features built
								directly into the Slack workspace so volunteers never had to do
								data entry in another window.
							</p>
							<Alert>
								Our main tool set at VoteAmerica was React, Gatsby, Django Rest
								Framework, with Bulma for CSS and Redshift and the Civis
								Platform for data engineering.

							<p>
								The OPEN is a networking body that works with around 20
								organisations from 20 different countries to help them share
								knowledge, engage in collaborations, and provide both material
								and moral support across countries, borders and cultures.
							</p>
							<p>
								During my 6 years leading the tech team, we helped over a dozen
								organisations put their tech team and stack together to launch,
								and then scale and hire, refactor or pivot, and more. By the end
								of my time there we were managing multiple shared-source
								products that were used across the network for our members&apos;
								most critical business tasks, like managing member
								communications, donations, activity databases, and online
								interactions.
							</p>
							<p>
								And I got to facilitate some of the most incredible events of my
								career: the annual tech summit, where every organisation would
								send their tech director and maybe one or two other staff and
								we&apos;d get about 50 people together in a conference center
								for a week and talk and share and hack and ask for help and
								share our plans for the future and see where the overlaps
								cropped up. So the job was part tech management and, on some
								levels, part diplomacy. I loved the relational aspect of the
								job, but it was also highly political and so eventually I burned
								out and decided to take my career toward the &ldquo;individual
								contributor&rdquo; role as a product manager.

							<Alert>
								Our main tools at OPEN were Rails, jQuery, Bootstrap, Heroku and
								Docker, WordPress â€“ and the unstoppable power of collaboration!

							<p>
								I started at BoldProgressives.org as the first employee, as a
								data manager and digital production manager, basically building
								and targeting emails and landing pages. When we decided to build
								out a web team to make more of our own organizing tools and take
								control of our most key workflows, I had the job of planning,
								hiring and managing it.
							</p>
							<p>
								It was a crash course in technical management as well as
								organisational management. As one of the trusted early staffers
								I was thrown into so many different situations like managing a
								TV ad shoot, or flying out to help a campaign set up a
								door-to-door volunteer operation and integrate the national
								voter database with their work, or taking donor meetings with
								foundations, or advising the founders on org structure as we
								scaled and adapted.
							</p>
							<p>
								And even after six years there and running a department, there
								were still times we&apos;d be on deadline and I&apos;d jump in
								to write SQL to target an email or double-check that a page had
								been built correctly (some things never change).
							</p>
							<Alert>
								We used a SAAS platform called ActionKit with our own Django
								templates, MySQL for targeting and Analytics, Bootstrap for
								styles, and a handful of Django apps and admins.
