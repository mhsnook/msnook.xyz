const intro = `Hello, thanks for checking out out my resume ðŸ‘‹ I&rsquo;m Em, a former
organiser, data manager (2009), tech facilitator (2014), turned product manager (2017) turned data engineer (2020)
turned full stack developer (2021). 

A few years ago I decided to get out of management roles and focus on my own output
as an individual contributor. It has been _excellent_ honing my craft at Product Management, Data Engineering, and Software Development.
But I've been freelancing for a few years now, and working on my own personal app totally alone, and I think what I miss now
is the experience of being part of a great team, being in flow, learning from and teaching each other, picking up slack &ndash; this
is the good stuff! So I'm looking for full-time or mostly-full-time employment, membership in a coop, or partnership in an agency to keep learning, keep shipping, keep going.

My biggest technical competencies are databases and React. Naturally I like to keep the back-end slim, so NextJS is a tool I use
often, or express API routes that deploy easily on Cloudflare or Vercel. But I have dabbled in all kinds of Javascript front ends,
spending time most recently with SvelteKit, SolidJS, Tanstack Router, using Tanstack Query almost everywhere, and Vite or Vinxi behind just
about everything but NextJS. And I'm practical about the back-end &ndash; If you've got API routes in Laravel or DRF or something, this won't be a problem.

Mostly I just want to work with good people, on a team that fosters productivity, growth and accountability. I want to learn
new things all the time, be excellent to my colleagues, ship quality product every cycle &ndash; and then close the computer at the end of the day and enjoy my weekend. If this sounds like
your kind of workplace, maybe we will work well!

    content: `[Sunlo](https://sunlo.app) is a labour of love, an app I started sketching out back in 2015 when I first came to India and wanted desperately to learn
  Hindi and Tamil and found myself interested but unable to get the most out of apps like Duolingo. Sunlo is a _social_ language learning app,
  that constantly reminds the learner that they have friends who speak the language and who are motivated to help them, to check in with them, to
  answer questions and recommend new phrases to learn.
    
  And Sunlo gives these friends and family members tools to help: a "friend mode" to search and recommend phrases, to add new ones to the public resource
  library, and to help the learner stay motivated along the way. The app is currently un-released, as I've mostly been using it as a playground to learn and 
  experiment, at least until a few months ago when I decided to really [dive in and rewrite it](https://sunlo-tanstack.vercel.app) using React, Tanstack Router & Query, TailwindCSS,
  ShadCN UI and Radix primitives. It also uses Tauri to compile to native iOS and Android apps. This fully client-side stack uses Supabase for the database
  and back-end API server, complete with row level security, RPC, auth, storage and transactional email.`,

    title: 'Mapplication Rebuild',
    time: '2023',
    content: `Rebuilt [map.350.org](https://map.350.org/), using React, Mapbox, react-map-gl, NextJS, a Google DataForm pipeline, BigQuery, and TailwindCSS.
    Each deployed page is its own embeddable mini-app, which 350 campaigners embed on different campaign pages to display different action information, or ways to
    get involved, sometimes with their own custom branding and layouts.

  The back-end is a few API routes hitting the BigQuery API to query views managed by a data pipeline built with Dataform to collate
    data from ActionKit, ActionNetwork and Salesforce. This project rebuilt both the back-end and the front-end, but the big win here was that
    we stopped using our own custom DRF-based ETL system and just used a data pipeline as intended. The resulting app is fast and reliable and takes much less work.`,

    title: 'MutualAidIndia.com',
    time: '2021',

    content: `The project began as a Google Doc with a crowdsourced list of ways that people could contribute to mutual aid funds,
    often for food aid, or clinics, or for oxygen tanks for community homes, and so on. Before long we had dozens of volunteers and
    loads of traffic, and we needed a site, and a basic (and non-standard) CMS. I built the MAI site with a Gatsby/Tailwind/Airtable
    starter kit, and assembled an Airtable vetting/contact system for the volunteers to track hundreds of different funds, and to
    vet and update listings. The team used it for at least 6 months while we were working.
    
  Here's [an article written by Riddhi Dastidar](https://thebaffler.com/latest/how-it-feels-dastidar), who started the whole thing with just a Google Doc and a sense of desperation to help people struggling with the first big wave of the COVID pandemic in India.`,

    title: 'VoteAmerica Data Pipeline',
    time: '2020',
    content: `I joined VoteAmerica late in the project but with still a few months of building left to go. It was a ~30
    person team with a well rounded 5-person engineering team, and they needed a dedicated Product Manager to take the
    load off the Engineering Team lead. By the end of it, we did not revolutionize voting entirely in the USA, but our goal
    was to create the best Voter Experience (VX) allowed by law in every state in the country, and I think we came darn close.
    
  Toward the end of the election cycle we pivoted hard to supporting the outreach programs, which made countless calls and
    send over 100 million text messages. I just happened to have experience with Redshift from my last job, and with the intricacies
    of US voter data from several prior experiences, so the task fell to me to build a sophisticated, constantly-updating voter
    identity-management service to provide millions of accurate, up-to-date phone numbers per day to our texting team, and get them
    accurate, relevant information for how to cast their vote.`,

                At Vote America I was called in to manage Product for the last 4
                months of the election cycle. We had a team of about 6 Engineers
                working on a national system to help voters look up their
                registration, request an absentee ballot, or get help with their
                voting journey.
              </p>
              <p>
                When Election Day got closer and we launched our campaign to
                send 10 crore text messages to voters across the country, the
                outreach team came to us for help with their data pipeline, and
                since election day was about 6 weeks away, most of the product
                was already managed, so I also built the SQL pipeline that
                updated our national voter file, selected the most likely/most
                accurate phone number for each household (or in many cases the
                most likely voter identity for a number) and built the priority
                lists for each state on a rolling/nightly basis.
              </p>
              <p>
                And I had the pleasure to manage an experiment in a truly new
                way of doing voter outreach: a system called The Voter Helpline
                which allows volunteers in a Slack team to claim and respond to
                incoming text messages from voters asking for help. In all my
                years doing organising through digital tools like this I&apos;ve
                never seen such incredible engagement rates as when we
                structured interactions this way, with volunteers in small
                &ldquo;pods&ldquo; that look out for each other&apos;s contacts,
                and a lot of claiming/assigning/notifying features built
                directly into the Slack workspace so volunteers never had to do
                data entry in another window.

                The OPEN is a networking body that works with around 20
                organisations from 20 different countries to help them share
                knowledge, engage in collaborations, and provide both material
                and moral support across countries aand borders and cultures.
              </p>
              <p>
                During my 6 years leading the tech team, we helped over a dozen
                organisations put their tech team and stack together to launch,
                and then scale and hire, refactor or pivot, and more. By the end
                of my time there we were managing multiple shared-source
                products that were used across the network for our members&apos;
                most critical business tasks, like managing member
                communications, donations, activity databases, and online
                interactions.
              </p>
              <p>
                And I got to facilitate some of the most incredible events of my
                career: the annual tech summit, where every organisation would
                send their tech director and maybe one or two other staff and
                we&apos;d get about 50 people together in a conference center
                for a week and talk and share and hack and ask for help and
                share our plans for the future and see where the overlaps
                cropped up. So the job was part tech management and, on some
                levels, part diplomacy. I loved the relational aspect of the
                job, but it was also highly political and so eventually I burned
                out and decided to take my career toward the &ldquo;individual
                contributor&rdquo; role as a product manager.

                I started at BoldProgressives.org as the first employee, as a
                data manager and digital production manager, basically building
                and targeting emails and landing pages. When we decided to build
                out a web team to make more of our own organizing tools and take
                control of our most key workflows, I had the job of planning out
                that team and managing the hiring.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was a crash course in technical management as well as
                organisational management. As one of the trusted early staffers
                I was thrown into so many different situations like managing a
                TV ad shoot, or flying out to help a campaign set up a
                door-to-door volunteer operation and integrate the national
                voter database with their work, or taking donor meetings with
                foundations, or advising the founders on org structure as we
                scaled and adapted.
              </p>
              <p>
                And even after six years there and running a department, there
                were still times we&apos;d be on deadline and I&apos;d jump in
                to write SQL to target an email or double-check that a page had
                been built correctly (some things never change).
