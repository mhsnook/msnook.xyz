FORMS
1. make InputImage a properly controlled component instead of calling setValue
1. RHF needs to learn to set values correctly rather than abusing the reset function
1. we shouldn't reset isDirty until after the edit form completes its successful post (better still to use RHF hook for this)

FRAMEWORK / ROUTER
1. Use error boundaries correctly. (rn a bad url results in an unstyled 500)
